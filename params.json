Sheppard - Samples","tagline":"a page to store github project samples","body":"### Welcome to my GitHub Page.\r\nThis is a site for storing different examples of things I have worked on:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Help Desk Request Form\r\nThis form was created with the intention of being a tool for tier 1 support at a multi-national company. The questions it goes through were compiled from a list of tasks there were being handled by the implementation team.  It was found that more often than not, the same few questions would prevent them from doing the leg-work of validating the basic information needed to start work.\r\n\r\n[Help Desk](HelpDeskRequestForm/request_form.htm)\r\n\r\n### Heatmap Rigs and Permits\r\nThis map application is to show a small sample of Oklahoma, Kansas, and Colorado looking for patterns in where Rigs and Permits are located.  It allows the user to control the data sources that are on the map and the attributes of the map markers.  \r\n\r\n[Heat Map](HeatMap/maps/index.htm)\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\nStatic Sample Report from the Heat Map:\r\n<p></p>\r\n[Sample Report](HeatMap/maps/Rigs_v_Permits_simple.JPG)\r\n\r\n\r\n### D3 Zoomable Sunburst\r\nThis data visualization uses the javascript library D3.  In order to obtain the look and functionality the javascript was customized heavily.  The sunburst shows the US Rig Counts for the 2nd week in September for years 2013 thru 2015 as provided by Baker Hughes.\r\n\r\nThis example demonstrates:\r\n- Zoomable Sunburst with Labels \r\n- Coloration of layers based on data in cells \r\n- Breadcrumb trail to highlight where the hover is \r\n- Change in opacity along the trail \r\n- Control of widths of layers based on order\r\n\r\n[Zoomable Sunburst](D3_Sunburst/index.html)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
