<p>This form was created with the intention of being a tool for tier 1 support at a multi-national company. The questions it goes through were compiled from a list of tasks there were being handled by the implementation team.  It was found that more often than not, the same few questions would prevent them from doing the leg-work of validating the basic information needed to start work.</p>
